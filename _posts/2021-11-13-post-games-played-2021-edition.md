## Games Beaten in 2021: 20
- **Delete** - Great little puzzle game. Kind of a mix of Sudoku and Minesweeper... really enjoyed it. 100% and the first beaten game of the year!
- **Path of Exile: Ritual** - This might be the best PoE expansion/league to date. I'm still working on maps, but I beat all the story stuff again, so I'm counting it again!
- **Lyser** - A pretty little puzzle game... quite short, but super pretty zen puzzle game. Definitely worth getting for a dollar.
- **Colorgrid** - Another zen puzzle game. This one is much harder and really takes some serious time. Definitely worth it for people that like puzzle games... very good, brain crushing puzzles.
- **Delta Force: Black Hawk Down** - An absolutely fantastic campaign experience that does a great job at adding difficulty by having hard levels, not just making enemies into bullet sponges. Great game!
- **LineWay** - Another line puzzle game. This one is well done, and I liked it, even though I'm bad at these types of spatial puzzles.
- **Halo 1: CE** - I really enjoyed this! It was an awesome experience and I really had a good time going through the campaign. I wish the soundtrack was more consistent throughout though.
- **Crying Suns** - A better evolution of the Faster Than Light style game, imo. Loved this experience, and really enjoyed the story. Some really great thoughtful moments in it.
- **Doom Eternal** - Honestly, preferred Doom 2016 and even some of the originals, but it was a fun romp... definitely a power fantasy. Played on easiest difficulty to rip and tear more!
- **Halo 2** - Wait, Halo has a story? I'm so involved now! I really enjoyed the little cutscenes that you could find in the game. Super fun campaign, still playing in coop... such an improvement over 1!
- **Control** - Fascinating story, the gameplay was tight. Didn't 100%, mostly played through the story... but the powers felt so... good, honestly. Almost makes me want to try a Jedi Academy game finally. :D
- **ESO: Blackwood** - Technically an expansion, but it was fun to play through! Now to go back to older ones that I've missed and figure out scrying!
- **The Outer Worlds** - Interesting game... didn't do the board storyline side at all, but the story was fun and I really liked Parvati especially! Very cool representation of the asexual community!
- **Elder Scrolls Online** - Finally got around to finishing the main story. The conclusion was good, definitely the best story questline that I've played in there. Enjoyed the experience, Coldharbor is awesome color palette, imo.
- **Darwinia** - Got this game ages ago... finally got around to playing it. The tutorial wasn't very good, but the story was more engaging than decided and it was just long enough for me. Fun playthrough overall!
- **Chronicon** - Fun little ARPG. Definitely one of the palate cleansers, rather than a full blown ARPG experience, imo. Very similar concept/design to Hero Siege.
- **Carto** - A very delightful game... definitely recommend playing it if the chance arises. Much deeper than expected.
- **Sniper Elite 3** - Honestly, I think I beat this game a year ago or something, but I had fun with it. First time on Steam for those sweet achievements. I played Easiest because I just like shooting things!
- **Final Fantasy 1 PR** - Awesome game, I love this title. Actually 100%'ed the game and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it.
- **Instant Farmer** - Small puzzle game. Not particularly good, a bit clunky... but it's an interesting take on the standard tile puzzle. Plus, super cheap!
