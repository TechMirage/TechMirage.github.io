## Achievement End 2021: 12,264

## Games Beaten in 2022: 40
- **Gorogoa**  - This is amazing. I love this game, it's very intuitive but also some really neat new mechanics. Love the move-able tiles! Great game to start the year with!
- **Guild Wars 2 - Core Personal Story** - Second time through this story... was great fun, did the whole thing in coop this time. Great game that you can pick up and put down whenever!
- **Final Fantasy 2 PR** - Super fun JRPG. I love these versions of these games. I got 100% again, took some grinding for spell/weapon levels, but I'm glad that I pushed through it. Looking forward to FF3!
- **Paperclips** - Browser based idle game. Played through one ascension, decided I'd seen it all. Fun game, some interesting management. Was a fun time! And FREE!
- **Blood Bowl 2** - Had a fun time through the campaign, though I wish you could play the campaign with a team other than Human. Fun times though... that game is pretty great!
- **Shadow Tactics - Blades of the Shogun** - Great real-time tactics game. If you were a person who wanted to replay levels for achievements/challenges, this would keep you busy for a LONG time.
- **Soldier of Fortune** - Mediocre spectacle shooter. Was a decent romp, but I played through on Easy and just lived the pistol fantasy. Not a great game, bugs with doors for example.
- **Hero of the Kingdom** - Interesting game... actually bought it for my wife immediately. Will be interesting to see what they change in the next one. 
- **Hero of the Kingdom II** - Significant improvement over the first game. Really fun times with a challenging, if a bit trope-y, fantasy story!
- **Hero of the Kingdom III** - Significantly worse than the second game. The grinding was bad, I really didn't like the direction of respawning things that this game went down. But 2 was really good!
- **Hero of the Kingdom - The Lost Tales 1** - Back to Hero 2 style! Love it, was a great game! Very short though, so keep that in mind... no more than 3 hours to 100%.
- **Shadow Warrior 2013** - Fun game, but not particularly great. It's a fun arena shooter type game, with a better than average story to tie it together. My second playthrough, first time on Normal.
- **Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons** - Best story that Guild Wars 2 has ever done, quite enjoyed my time.  I'll probably play it again on a different character at some point!
- **Saint's Row 3 - Remastered** - I've played SR3 before and still think it's the best Saint's Row game. Had a great time with the remaster with mostly no bugs. 79% complete when I finished with it.
- **Super Auto Pets** - Going to keep playing this, as it's a nice bite sized game to play between things, but I got my first 10 win run, so I'm going to count it here, especially as my hours on it keep going up!
- **Hellbound** - A serviceable Doom clone that is pretty short. It's a fun game, shoots well, no bugs. But the campaign took me less than four hours. Granted I played on "Noob" difficulty, but yeah.
- **Slay the Spire** - Won several daily challenges. Will keep playing, but I feel like I've seen quite a bit of the game at this point and am adding it to this list. GREAT roguelike though... very solid. (started getting normal wins now! WOO)
- **Borderlands 3** - Not my first time through, but it was fun to play again. Played Normal mode on Siren this time, was good... enough that I jumped right back to the beginning with Moze! (edit: didn't happen)
- **Path of Exile: Sentinel** - Another finished run... this one isn't my favorite. The new changes for this season, not a fan, though the league mechanic is dope.
- **Sniper: Ghost Warrior** - A fun romp for sure. Wouldn't spend a lot of money on it though. Went through on Easy and finished in around 4 hours or so (with a couple of reloads in there). The last mission was such an anti-climactic one though... 
- **Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2** - Definite improvement over the first one. Also, the Cry Engine is so pretty! This is based on Cry Engine 3 and it was a gorgeous game, even now!
- **Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga** - Super fun! Typical Lego game of course, but it was a fun experience and quite enjoyed my time. Hilarious that I know the lore of Star Wars because of the Lego games, not the movies.
- **Buggos** - A fun little auto-battler RTS. I think the last zone felt extraneous and a bit overstayed its welcome, but in general this was a fun game. I could see having an expansion with more bugs and more enemies. I wish there had been more story, cause the start and end cutscene were pretty hilarious.
- **Grid Miner** - Cute little game, it's very short. But it was quite a bit of fun. The last mission was timed, which I didn't particularly enjoy but overall solid game.
- **Dice Tribes: Ambition** - Very much enjoyed my time here... great little dice rolling worker placement game. I hope that they keep expanding it, but for the time being I've won with every scenario and seen all ambitions!
- **Red Alert 2** - Grew up on this game, but this is the first time I've beaten both campaigns. I absolutely love this game and am VERY excited about going on to the expansion soon!
- **Guild Wars Prophecies** - Beat it with a friend using most of the Iron Man rules on the wiki. I've beaten this before, but still is my favorite MMO of all time.
- **Guild Wars Factions** - Beat it with the same rules as above. The last mission was rough, but we made it. It's my least favorite GW expansion, glad it's over and we can go on to the best!
- **XCOM: Chimera Squad** - Enjoyed my time through this game, though I played it on an easier difficulty. Was getting slower and slower as the game went on, but no game breaking bugs, which is always a plus with the newer XCOM games. Very cool "breach" mechanics, loved that.
- **Path of Exile: Lake of Kalandra** - They fixed the acts levelling progress, and I love that. Hearing that drop rates are nerfed in maps, but it shouldnt' matter to me too much, I would imagine. Righteous Fire is fire!
- **Destiny 2: Beyond Light** - Taking advantage of free week, I am catching up on D2 expansions. This one was okay, I didn't love it. The stasis powers kinda feel rather meh compared to what I was rocking before, but as always, I enjoyed the campaign!
- **Destiny 2: Witch Queen** - More free week! This story was much better than Beyond Light and felt way more fun. The new Throne World setting was also very cool. This was one of the better campaigns that they've ever done.
- **Grim Dawn** - Not my first time through, but wow that's good. Using GrimInternals to speed things up to 1.5x speed. Played a Ravenous Earth Vitality Caster... good times! Might see how far I get in Elite this time around... or may start another build too. I love this game.
- **Spiderman: Remastered** - One of the open world games that I've enjoyed the most, frankly. Really enjoyed swinging around New York cleaning up crime and the motion sickness didn't set in too! Didn't love the boss fights, but did all main story + DLC.
- **Dungeon Defenders** - A solid tower defense game with the addition of having a hero that can do things during the match. It's not my favorite TD game ever, but it's fun, especially when playing with a friend. Mostly used a builder Apprentice while a friend used a builder Summoner.
- **Monster Train** - Interesting card based roguelike. Lots of potential grinding. I have beaten a run on normal mode. I might keep playing this, but having more fun with Across the Obelisk, frankly.
- **WoW: Ascension Server** - Private server for WoW but I hit max level and have been doing a bunch of dungeons as a healer. Also did Battlegrounds for a while. Was a very fun way to try out higher level classic WoW that I've never done before. The seasonal server is a classless ability-draft experience that was quite interesting. Might play more, but mostly done here.
- **God of War(2018)** - Great story and setting, I loved the focus on Norse mythology, especially so much that was lesser known, and the teaser at the end about Atreus' real name was exquisite. However, gameplay I felt like it was a slightly worse Tomb Raider game. Turned difficulty down to enjoy the combat.
- **Across the Obelisk** - This is my favorite of the card-based roguelike games so far. It's very good and I am excited to continue playing it. As of writing, I've had wins on normal and Madness 1 and have unlocked most of the cards and heroes. More to play definitely!
- **Diablo 2: Median XL** - Diablo 2 mod that is super fun to play. Season reset and I've beaten Baal the first time. Will continue playing this as well, but technically did beat the main story. Farming for upgrades before entering Nightmare at this point on my Necro Summoner (Pokemancer).
